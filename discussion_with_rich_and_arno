SISO:
Degenerate kernels - sparse spectrum when degenerate.
Add SDE representation / markovian structure as an extra column; finite basis functions can be represented as a state-space model.
Sparse precision (SDE) vs sparse covariance (compact support)
KISS-GP? Model vs approximation
Titsias. When is it exact? (Nyquist). PSD has compact support.

JMLR submission; Arno. Sparse spectrum as Monte Carlo.
Kernel literature; Orthogonal Random Features.

Weak integral approximations.
Weak stochastic Runge Kutta methods.

Visualising the space of methods. What is the best way to do this?

MISO:
Isotropic - RQ? When is a kernel non-separable.
    RQ-ARD: Non-separable, stationary, non-isotropic.
    Products over dimensions.

Inference up to a reparametrisation.

MIMO:
What special structure is fundamentally just a thing in MIMO?


Approximate inference when stuff is linear and Gaussian.

Going non-Gaussian?

Bayesian Committee Machine? Marc Deisenroth.

Neal - work on MCMC for Gaussian models?
Quadrature?

Write up? Forward-looking / position paper.

Climate data.

Does Darwin have any family accomodation?
4th December - 4th June.
